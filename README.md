This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust programming: creating multiple mutable borrows of the same variable.  The `bug.rs` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.rs` shows how to correct it using techniques like cloning, interior mutability (e.g., using `RefCell` or `Mutex`), or restructuring the code to avoid conflicting borrows. Understanding Rust's ownership and borrowing system is essential to write safe and efficient Rust code.  This example highlights the importance of careful consideration when working with mutable references.
